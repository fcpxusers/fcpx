# Introduction

> **NOTE:** This database is not affiliated with Apple or the Final Cut Pro X Development Team

This is a public database of bugs, feature requests and improvement suggestions. This resource has no official connection with Apple, or with the Final Cut Pro X development team, but it provides a central location for FCPX users to log issues, workaround and ideas for improving the product.

## Suggested Procedure

1. **Check** if an existing issue covers the same topic [here](https://github.com/fcpxusers/fcpx/issues).
2. If so, **add a reaction or a comment** to indicate your support.
3. If not, **create a new issue** [here](https://github.com/fcpxusers/fcpx/issues/new).
4. **Send feedback** to Apple [here](https://www.apple.com/feedback/finalcutpro.html). You may want to link to the issue page to give them context.

Sending feedback is critical, since that is how Apple will actually become aware of the problem - this site is just for users to collaborate and suggest fixes/workarounds/implementations.
