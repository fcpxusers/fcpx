# Introduction

This is a public database of bugs, feature requests and improvement suggestions. This resource has no official connection with Apple, or with the Final Cut Pro X development team, but it provides a central location for FCPX users to log issues, workaround and ideas for improving the product.

If you create a new issue report, or think it is useful, you should also [email Apple](https://www.apple.com/feedback/finalcutpro.html) so that the development team is aware of how many people think it would be useful to address.

In the meantime, go to the [issue database](https://github.com/fcpxusers/fcpx/issues) to review, comment or star your pet peeve about FCPX.
